                             <p>The history of Zamboanga del Norte National High School dates back to 1946, when it began as a small pioneering class in what is known as the overpopulated "dumping pit" of Zamboanga del Norte, which includes its twin cities of Dipolog and Dapitan with their large enrolment.
                             <br>
                             The people of the once-unified Zamboanga Peninsula were so desperate for higher education that they traveled to the nearby island provinces of Negros and Cebu. Through the efforts of former governor Felipe B. Azcuna, the provincial government authorized the transfer of Zamboanga Provincial High School, which was then located in the former capital town of Zamboanga (now Zamboanga City), to Azcuna's hometown in up-northern Dipolog.

                            <br>
                            Zamboanga del Norte National High School Turno has developed into a vibrant educational powerhouse over time, fostering social advancement and community development. From modest beginnings to its current position as one of the top educational establishments, the school has persevered through hardship. Through the utilization of specialized programs such as the Special Program in Sports and Strengthened Technical Vocational Education, ZNNHS Turno prepares its students for success in a world that is changing quickly. Building upon a solid foundation of honesty, creativity, and diversity, the school continues to motivate students to pursue their dreams and realize their greatest potential.
